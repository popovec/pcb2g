pcb2g
=====

pcb2g is converter from image to g-code. Scanned image from PCB (in pbm or
pgm format) is analyzed and G-code for CNC router is generated.

This software is designed to run on linux and cnc code is designed for
linuxcnc.

Compilation:
------------

download source, change directory to source tree, run "make"

Example usage:
--------------

Convert PCB image (white = isolation black = copper) to .pbm file (in example
below pcb.ppm) - for example with "convert" from imagemagick software.

Then use pcb.pbm as input for pcb2g. You also need to give information about
dimension of PCB (arguments after -X and -Y switches ) and specify the
output file (after -O switch).

./pcb2g -o -b -X 40.132000 -Y 26.924000 -O pcb.ngc pcb.pbm

Examine output file pcb.ngc, use it in linuxcnc.

Please check Licence before use.
